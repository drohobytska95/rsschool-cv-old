### ✍ About myself:
I started working as a call center operator five years ago, and since then changed my position several times, climbing the corporate ladder. And when I had been appointed to a leading position, I understood that I could not continue staying there long without any opportunity to develop, because the top was already reached, so that I decided to try something else.

A friend of mine recommended me to start studying at *RS School* - she supposed that I would be interested in *front-end developing*, and was absolutely right. I have just learned *HTML, CSS and JavaScript basics*, but am already sure that is an appropriate field for me, because it gives me a chance to learn something new all my life (I love learning ♥), put my knowledge into practice immediately and see the result - these are the things I appreciate the most. 

### ✍ Skills:
* HTML5, CSS3;
* JavaScript;
* Git, GitHub;
* Visual Studio Code.

### ✍ Code:
```
function multiply(a, b){
  return a * b
}
```

### ✍ Experience:
I do not have any experience of working as a front-end developer, but I am studying at *RS School* right now and have already done some tasks.
[Here is my CV](https://www.pinterest.ru/pin/718464946812395964/) that is made with the help of *HTML and CSS*, for example.

### ✍ Education:
I was studying at *Kherson State University* from 2013 till 2017 and got *a Bachelor Degree in Translation and Interpretation*. I continued studying after that and got *a Master degree* in the end of 2018.

And here are some **courses** I have already taken:
* HTML for beginners at *Code Basics* (completed);
* CSS for beginners at *Code Basics* (completed);
* JavaScript for beginners at *Code Basics* (in progress);
* JavaScript/Front-end pre-school at *RS School* (in progress).

### ✍ Languages:
* **Ukrainian and Russian:** native speaker;
* **English:** Intermediate according to [EF SET](https://www.efset.org/ru).\
