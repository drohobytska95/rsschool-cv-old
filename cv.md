### ✍ About myself:
I started working as a call center operator five years ago, and since then changed my position several times, climbing the corporate ladder. And when I had been appointed to a leading position, I understood that I could not continue staying there long without any opportunity to develop, because the top was already reached, so that I decided to try something else.

A friend of mine recommended me to start studying at *RS School* - she supposed that I would be interested in *front-end developing*, and was absolutely right. I have just learned *HTML, CSS and JavaScript basics*, but am already sure that is an appropriate field for me, because it gives me a chance to learn something new all my life (I love learning ♥), put my knowledge into practice immediately and see the result - these are the things I appreciate the most. 

### ✍ Skills:
* HTML5, CSS3;
* JavaScript;
* Git, GitHub;
* Visual Studio Code.

### ✍ Code:
```
function multiply(a, b){
  return a * b
}
```
